**ECG Signal Classification for Arrhythmia Detection**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The goal is to classify the signals into 5 distinct classes representing different types of arrhythmia.

**Dataset**

Source: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database

The data consists of ECG signals labeled into 5 classes.

**The models used include**:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

Hybrid Systems combining LSTM and GRU

1D CNN and GRU Hybrid System (in a separate notebook)
